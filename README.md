# CRISPR_nongenetic_model

This is the project website for an [NSF Funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923234&HistoricalAwards=false) to develop CRISPR technologies for non-model organisms. Specifically, we seek to use CRISPR to explore the role of whole-genome duplication in genome evolution and to provide resources to study the origin and evolution of the flower.

We are endeavored to disseminate CRISPR toolkits to the community. Bacterial strains and cloning plasmids are freely available for research purposes upon request from either Yang or Soltis laboratory under an MTA. Please submit a request [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6GB6nu0ErslIYLW5fchqvGOwfB_hAtqo83KDwEQ8pTIuL3Q/viewform).
